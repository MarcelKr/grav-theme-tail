# Installation

Installing the Tail theme can be done in one of two ways. Our GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method enables you to quickly and easily install the theme with a simple terminal command, while the manual method enables you to do so via a zip file. 

The theme by itself is useful, but you may have an easier time getting up and running by installing a skeleton. The Tail theme can be found in both the [One-page](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-skeleton-onepage-site) and [Blog Site](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-skeleton-blog-site) which are self-contained repositories for a complete sites which include: sample content, configuration, theme, and plugins.

## GPM Installation (Preferred)

The simplest way to install this theme is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) through your system's Terminal (also called the command line).  From the root of your Grav install type:

    bin/gpm install tail

This will install the Tail theme into your `/user/themes` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/themes/tail`.

## Manual Installation

To install this theme, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/themes`. Then, rename the folder to `tail`. You can find these files either on [GitHub](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-tail) or via [GetGrav.org](http://getgrav.org/downloads/themes).

You should now have all the theme files under

    /your/site/grav/user/themes/tail

# Site options

## Footer
The footer links can be adapted in your `site.yaml` like this:

    footer:
      links:
        - text: Terms
          url: '/datenschutz'
        - text: Conditions
          url: '/impressum'
      social:
        - icon: gitlab
          url: https://gitlab.com/marcelkr
        - icon: github
          url: https://gitlab.com/marcelkr

To use the social links with icons install [
grav-plugin-embed-fontawesome](https://github.com/N-Parsons/grav-plugin-embed-fontawesome) and follow the steps to set up the SVG files needed.

## Matomo
Matomo is also configured via `site.yaml`. This is how a sample configuration:

    matomo:
        enabled: true
        matomo_url: matomo.mysite.de
        site_id: 1

Once enabled, the partial `partials/matomo.html.twig` is included in the base template.
`matomo_url` denotes the matomo URL. `site_id` configures the site ID used in Matomo.
If you have several sites configured it might be != 1.

# Style customizing
Most of the style can be customized by adapting the `class` attributes in the templates. This is the idea of tailwindcss's [Utility-First Approach](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first).

**Important**: The final css file is cleaned up with `postcss-purgecss` and minified by `postcss-clean`. Meaning: `postcss-purgecss` looks through your twig template files, recognizes which classes you used and then deletes all unused CSS from the final stylesheet. Then the sylesheet is minified using `postcss-clean`.

In case you're trying to add classes to the templates and nothing changes, it is possible that these classes aren't used anywhere else and therefore not present in the cleaned `main.css`. See [Workflow](#workflow) on how to generate the stylesheet.

## Workflow [](#workflow)
- Change to the `themes/tail` directory
- Install the dependencies: `npm install`
- Generate the stylesheet:
  - For development: `npm run compile`
  - For production: `NODE_ENV=production npm run compile`

In the development mode, `main.css` is not cleaned up. All of tailwinds classes can be used. In production mode, `main.css` is cleaned and minified.

If you want to adapt how tailwind is generated, have a look at `tailwind.config.js`. If you want to adapt how postcss works, look at `postcss.config.js`. 

# Optional Plugins

## Markdown-Notices

The [Markdown-Notices](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-markdown-notices) Plugin is supported 
and has custom styling. I suggest the following custom configuration for the plugin:

```
enabled: true
built_in_css: false
level_classes: [indigo, green, yellow, red]
```

Note `level_classes` being reordered and `blue` being replaced by `indigo`.

## Pagination

[Pagination](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-pagination) works out of the box and needs no further configuration.

## Langswitcher

The language switching template is included in the navbar as soon as the plugin
[Langswitcher](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-langswitcher)
is enabled and more than one language is available in the `languages.supported` 
array in the `system.yaml` config file.

For the exact behaviour and tweaking see `partials/langswitcher.html.twig`
